description: Where the Apple Silicon stack stands, and what is deliberately left out of the first release.
section: Reference
---

This manual describes the stack the first release installs. The packages are built here, in omacom/omarchy-mac-pkgs, against the Omarchy of [omacom/omarchy#14431](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/pull/14431), following [the convergence spec](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy-mac/blob/quattro-upstream/docs/apple-silicon-convergence.md). Until that release, read every page as the target, not as something you can install today.

## Order of work

1. The installer app on omacom/omarchy-mac-installer reaches parity with the last qualified Apple Silicon installer.
2. The Mac packages (`omarchy-mac`, `omarchy-mac-boot`, `linux-aurora`, `m1n1-aurora`, `uboot-asahi` and the carried aquamarine) land on Omarchy's `edge` channel, aarch64 only.
3. The first test images, built from omarchy-mac's `quattro-upstream` before the packages moved here, are installed on the M2 Max, then on the M1 Pro.
4. The remaining Mac features move behind the platform detector and dispatch points: audio, Wi-Fi resume, display, video decode, the encryption lifecycle, snapshots and boot verification.
5. The generic changes are proposed to omacom/omarchy, in order: the platform detector and profiles; composable boot configuration and generic encryption fixes; the dispatch interface.
6. The move for existing Macs, a standalone migration script outside the packages, is built and tested for each kind of install.
7. After cold-boot qualification on the M1 Pro and the M2 Max, the packages are promoted to `rc` and `stable` and the stable installer catalog is published.
8. Once the generic changes are merged into Omarchy and the move has been accepted for each kind of install, the move for existing Macs is switched on.

## Not in the first release

- M3 and M4 Macs, Touch ID, MLX and Secure Enclave disk encryption. Each is separate work.
- Encrypting an unencrypted Mac in place while moving it from an earlier install. It may come later as an opt-in.
- The Asahi kernel as a supported choice. Every Mac runs Aurora.
- A portable installer that runs without installing a privileged helper.
- Moving the installer's signing identity and catalog hosting to Omarchy's own. That is a later configuration change.

Known hardware issues are listed under [Hardware support]({{page:hardware}}).
